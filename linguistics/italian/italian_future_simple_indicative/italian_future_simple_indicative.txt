    Futuro Semplice
    
      The future simple in Italian is used to indicate any action that is
      programmed or that has the possibility to happen in the future. This is
      perhaps the aspect of the future that agrees the most in all languages.
    

    
      Example:
      
        Domani andrÃ² a Roma.
      
    

    
      It can also be used epistemically. The epistemic future expresses doubt.
      Spanish uses this form quite commonly as well.
    

    
      Example:
      
        SarÃ  Monica allâ€™universitÃ ?
      
    

    
      There is yet another use called the concessive use, which acknowledges a
      fact to be true but not worthy of importance. An aspect of the future that
      Spanish also uses to denote or emphasize disregard for a factual claim.
    

    
      Example:
      
        
          Queste scarpe saranno di moda, ma non mi piacciono affatto.
        
      
    

    
      As opposed to the other tenses,
      <span class="bg-eta"
        >the conjugation of the future tense does not begin from the stem of the
        verb, but rather from the very last vowel of each of the three
        endings.</span
      >
    

    
      Example:
      
        
          Partire is not conjugated from the stem
          part</i
          >, but from partir</i
          >.
        
      
    

    
      This is quite nice because it allows the conjugations to share the same
      inflections for all three endings (are, ere, ire).
    

    Conjugation
    
      Singular: -Ã², ai, Ã 
      Plural: -emo, -ete, -anno
    

    
      However, for verbs ending in -are, the A must be replaced with an
      E. Therefore, in reality, it is left with only two endings,
      -ere and -ire.
