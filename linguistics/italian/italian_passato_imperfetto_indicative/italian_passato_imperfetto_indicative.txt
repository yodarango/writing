    Introduction
    
      The passato imperfetto is used for ongoing or habitual
      actions in the past. It signifies that an action not only happened once,
      but it was an ongoing action. The imperfect past is second to the perfect
      past in terms of popularity and day-to-day usage, meaning that it is used
      extensively in prolonged conversations.

        >A solid knowledge of the passato prossimo and the
        passato imperfetto will render the learner ready with most
        of the past conjugations needed to carry a meaningful conversation in
        Italian.</span
      >
      This tense does not make use of a helping verb like the
      passato perfetto does. There are also fewer irregular cases.
