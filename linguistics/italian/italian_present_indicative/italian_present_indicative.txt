    Introduction
    
      The Italian present tense is by far the easiest and most common
      conjugation of the Italian verbs, and perhaps of the verbs in any
      language.
    

    Conjugation
    
      
        -are
        
          singular: o, i, a
          plural: iamo, ate, ano
        
      
      
        -ere
        
          singular: o, i, e
          plural: iamo, ete, ono
        
      
      
        -ire
        
          singular: o, i , e
          plural: iamo, ite, ono
        
      
    

    Irregularities

    
      Irregularities concerning the -are termination
      are verbs which root ends in G or C. These verbs adopt an
      H to dull the sound of the C and G (think of the
      U in the Spanish to dull the G sound). This procedure is
      applied to the 2S and 1P.

        >Examples: giocare, pagare â†’ h â†’ giochi,
        paghi.</span
      >
    
    
      A second irregularity rule comes packed in the verb roots ending in
      I. To these, the I is simply removed in the 2S and 1P at the
      time of conjugating it.
      
      <span class="d-block mt-2 border-top border-alpha ms-4"
        >Examples: mangiare â†’ i â†’ mangi (notice that if it was
        not removed it would be magii)</span
      >
    
    
      For the termination, -ire the conjugational
      irregularities include verbs like capire, pulire, finire, obbedire, etc.
      None of these irregularities follow a rule. They must be memorized. Such
      irregular verbs are conjugated as follows: - The last letter of the verb
      stem takes on a SC for the 1S, 2S, 3S, and 3P.

      
      <span class="d-block mt-2 border-top border-alpha ms-4"
        >Example: capire, pulire, finire â†’ sc â†’ capisco,
        pulisco, finisco.</span
      >
