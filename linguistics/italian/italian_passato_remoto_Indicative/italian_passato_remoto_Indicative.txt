    Introduction
    
      The passato remoto has been gradually disappearing from the
      Italian tongue. In some parts of Italy this vanishing is taking place at a
      faster pace. It is safe to say that, although this tense is still used in
      daily conversations, its use has come to be reserved almost exclusively to
      formal writing. One of the factors that have brought this tense to its
      present state is its many irregularities. Though the conjugations below
      apply to the majority of verbs, the verbs that break these rules are many.
    

    
      
        -are
        
          Singular: ai, asti, ò
          Plural: ammo, aste, arono
        
      
      
        -ere
        
          For the second conjugation “-ere,” it is important to mention that
          there are two possible endings for the 1S, 3S, and 3P as displayed
          below.
        
        
          Singular: ei/etti, esti, è/ette
          Plural: emmo, este, erono/ettero
        
      
      
        -ire
        
          Singular: ii, isti, ì
          Plural: immo, iste, irono
        
      
    

    Irregularities

    
      Most differentiable irregularities happen in the verbs essere</i
      >, as well as in the modal verbs—as is their tendency in many languages.
      The most common modal verbs are
      dovere, potere, volere, sapere.
    

    
      All verbs whose stem ends in V, M, R, T, GG, or RR replace
      each of these instances with SS. This change only happens in the
      1S, 3S, and 3P, nonetheless.
    
    
      Examples:
      
        io lego → io lessi
        lui/lei leggi → lui/lei lesse
        loro leggono → loro lessero
      
    

    
      To these irregularities, there are more irregularities, as is to be
      expected. Some verbs do not get a double S but a single S.
    

    
      Verbs whose stem ends in N, V, or ND are ended in a single
      S.
    
    
      Examples:
      
        io prendo → io presi
        lui/lei prende → lui/lei prese
        loro prendono → loro presero
      
    

    
      Yet, verbs whose stem ends not in ND but in D will replace
      the D with a single S.
    
    
      Examples:
      
        io chiudo → io chiusi
        lui/lei chiude → lui/lei chiuse
        loro chiudono → loro chiusero
      
    

    
      Verbs whose stem ends in SC will replace it with CQU in the
      1S, 3S, and 3P.
    
    
      Examples:
      
        io piacio → io piacqui
        lui/lei piace → lui/lei piacque
        loro piaciono → loro piacquero
      
    

    
      An irregularity to this irregularity is the verb
      conoscere, which, though ending in SC adopts
      BB
      instead of CQU.
    

    
      Verbs whose stem ends in NG adopt NS instead.
    
    
      Examples:
      
        io fingo → io finsi
        lui/lei finge → lui/lei finse
        loro fingono → loro finsero
      
    

    
      Other verbs whose stem ends in GLI will take NS
    
    
      Examples:
      
        io toglio → io tolsi
        lui/lei toglie → tolse
        loro togliono → loro tolsero
      
    

    Verbs whose stem ends in RG will take RS
    
      Examples:
      
        io scorgo → io scorsi
        lui/lei scorge → lui/lei scorse
        loro scorgono → loro scorsero
      
    

    When to Use
    
      It may be used in most situations where the English “I did” would satisfy
      the case.
