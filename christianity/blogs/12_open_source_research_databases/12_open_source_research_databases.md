# **12 Open Source Research Databases**

Before beginning my studies at BIOLA University, my approach to research and writing was somewhat scattered. However, three years and one degree later, I developed a deep passion for writing. My extensive efforts as an academic writer were greatly supported by access to an array of databases, including prestigious platforms like JSTOR. Recognizing that many individuals may not have access to such resources, I took it upon myself to compile a list of accessible resources that provide free, high-quality scholarly material. This compilation is specifically curated for those interested in conducting theological research.

### **1\. [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)** 

A freely accessible web search engine that indexes the full text or metadata of scholarly literature across various formats and disciplines. It allows users to search for academic papers, theses, books, conference proceedings, patents, and court opinions. Out of all the methods explored so far, this is my favorite, though it is also the most cluttered, since not all the material comes from reliable or academic sources; therefore, good judgment must be exercised.

### **2\.** [**Hollis Harvard**](https://hollis.harvard.edu/)

The Hollis Harvard library offers thousands of resources open to the public. Searching through the main search text input will display articles for both affiliates and the general public. To filter those available to the public, it is necessary to apply the filter labeled **Open Access.** One of my most recommended sources for research, though the free content is limited.

### **3\. [BASE Search](https://www.base-search.net/)**

One of the world's most voluminous search engines, especially for academic web resources. It provides access to open-access academic content across multiple disciplines, including theology. One disadvantage of this engine is that it does not seem to update its indexes too frequently, which might lead to broken source links.

### **4\. [Academia](https://www.academia.edu/)**

A platform for academics and researchers to share research papers, articles, and other scholarly works. Though it is not the same as traditional academic databases, which often provide access to peer-reviewed journals and articles by the best experts in a particular field, it is a valuable resource for discovering and sharing research.

### **5\. [JSTOR Open Access](https://about.jstor.org/oa-and-free/)**

While JSTOR typically requires a subscription, JSTOR Open Access provides free access to thousands of journal articles and books. It includes a variety of academic content, some of which is related to theology and religious studies. One of my favorite sources for academic articles, though the free content is quite limited.

### **6\. [ATLA Digital Library](https://dl.atla.com/)** 

A platform provided by the American Theological Library Association (ATLA). The ATLA Digital Library offers access to digital resources related to theology, religion, and related disciplines. Though I do not heavily frequent it for academic articles, I visit it for materials like historical documents, manuscripts, books, and other theological resources.

### **7\. [Christian Classics Ethereal Library (CCEL)](https://www.ccel.org/)**

A digital library that offers free access to a large collection of Christian texts, including works by early church fathers, medieval authors, reformers, and more. The library is dedicated to making classic Christian writings widely available to the public. The reason for its position in this list is not due to the quality of its content, but rather due to its nature. Since the material is often sermonic or devotional, I do not consider it extensively for academic writing.

### **8\. [HathiTrust](https://www.hathitrust.org/)**

It offers millions of digitized titles from libraries around the world. While not all content is freely accessible, a significant portion of public domain works and some open-access publications are available.

### **9\. [Project MUSE](https://muse.jhu.edu/)**

It provides some open-access content, particularly in the humanities and social sciences. It’s a valuable resource for scholarly articles and books, though not all content is free. In my limited personal use, I have found the open-access material to be rather scarce. However, the amount of results obtained is directly correlated to my area of focus; there could be more abundant sources in themes I have not explored.

### **10\. [CORE](https://core.ac.uk/)**

 It aggregates open-access research outputs from repositories and journals worldwide. It offers a large collection—the largest, they claim—of full-text scholarly articles across all disciplines, including many in the field of theology. However, the theological search results are not voluminous in comparison to other disciplines. CORE makes a better ally for scientific research.

### **11\. [WorldCat](https://search.worldcat.org/)**

A global catalog of library collections. You can search for books, articles, and other resources and see if they are available in nearby libraries or in digital format. Some libraries offer free access to databases for registered users.

### **12\. [Princeton Theological Seminary Commons](https://commons.ptsem.edu/)** 

A digital library of over 150,000 resources on theology and religion, hosted by Princeton Theological Seminary. This collection includes books, articles, and other scholarly works available for free. However, much of the material from this database is not contemporary.
