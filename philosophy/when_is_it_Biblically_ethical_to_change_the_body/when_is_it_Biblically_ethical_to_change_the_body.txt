When is it Biblically Ethical to Change the Body?

By Daniel Rangel.

It has been revealed to me that you stand against the alteration of sexual gender. Tell me, according to the ethics of the Bible, when is it permissible to alter the anatomy of the body then?

------

Regarding the alteration of the bodyâ€™s anatomy, it is biblically ethical to do so when the alteration adds value to the person as a whole and does not intrude with its original functionality. Since we are bearers of God's image (Genesis 1:26), any modification to the body must be a change that contributes to and does not diminish its value.

------

But how can I know if an alteration adds or subtracts value from the physical body? Is it not true that most changes contribute to the total value of the body, especially if they are voluntary?

------

No, this is not always the case. There are anatomical alterations that add value to the body. For example, amputating a leg to prevent gangrene from advancing is a surgery that adds value, since it preserves the health of the rest of the body. In this case, the amputation adds value to the remaining body even if it changes its anatomy. Similarly, an eye transplant increases the anatomical value because it allows the person to live in a world where the absence of an eye would be a disadvantage. Thus, the acquisition of a foreign eye completes the body. Nonetheless, there are many cases where the opposite is true. For instance, a gender change is not an example of a change that adds value, as it implies that the body, as it is in its current state, does not have its maximum value and that the change is made to "improve" it. Such a change devalues the overall value of the body because it alters the anatomy from the point of view that its design is defective.

But why do you say that a gender change is wrong, whereas the use of a prosthesis is not? They are both done from the perspective that the body, as it is in its current state, is defective.

------

True, they both are done for the enhancement of the body from the perspective that it is in a present state of malfunction. But only the alteration of sexual gender deviates from its original design, while an eye transplant aims towards a closer proximity to its original design. Moreover, the eye transplant is not the same as a gender change for two reasons. First, the eye transplant is performed to overcome a physical disadvantage, which cannot be argued in the case of a gender change. A person who remains in their birth gender is not at a disadvantage compared to one who changes it. In fact, there are more physical disadvantages that arise from a gender change, such as the potential loss of reproductive capacity. Second, an eye transplant serves to restore a normal functionality of the body, whereas a gender change goes against the normal, natural structure of the body.

------

But who are you to stipulate what is normal, advantageous, or disadvantageous for me? In the same way that a person might find it useful to have a foreign eye in their body, I may find advantage in changing my gender. For them, the advantage is in improving their sight, whereas for me, the benefit is to be at peace with myself. So, being at peace with myself is for me a greater advantage than the ability to reproduce my genes.

------

I can admit that gene reproduction is not advantageous for all people. In this, I am mistaken. But one thing you still haven't understood is that we are talking about the original design and the maximum anatomical capacity of a person. Therefore, psychological value does not enter into our discussion. I am not saying that being at peace with oneself has no value, I am merely saying that this is not part of our current argument. I am focusing solely on the maximum anatomical capacity.

------

I repeat once again, who are you to define what the maximum anatomical capacity for a person is? Even worse, your logic seems to suggest that people born with disabilities have less value because their anatomy does not reach a "maximum" capacity.

------

Please, do not misunderstand me. I have never said that people with disabilities have less value than those with full abilities. Biblically, all people have the same value, not only because they are made in the image of God but also because they were created by God. Therefore, if God in His sovereignty has decided that a person must live with a disability, that person arrives on Earth with their maximum value as an individual and does not have less value than a person with complete physical abilities. Remember, we are only talking about anatomical value, not overall personal value. Moreover, a person with disabilities has not altered their anatomy by their own will. Therefore, any change to their anatomy that improves their abilities adds value, rather than subtracting it. In this case, we could say that we are adding value to their anatomy because we are elevating their abilities to what is considered the norm in our world.

Should we refrain from giving eyes to someone born without them, simply to avoid taking away value from their anatomy? No, because we know that giving eyes does not decrease their value. It adds to it. Moreover, it is not up to me to decide the value of people's bodies, because I am not the Creator. It is God who does this precisely because He is the Creator (Ezekiel 18:4). Therefore, the value of anatomy is not derived only from the benefits obtained through an alteration but from the benefits obtained without violating God's original plan. We do not read that God created humans with two legs and two arms, but we do read that He created them male and female (Genesis 1:27). Therefore, we do not violate God's law by putting an eye in a person's eye socket, but we do violate it by altering their gender.

------

So what is your conclusion on this?

------

My conclusion is that it is permissible to alter the anatomy of a body when it adds value and does not violate God's original intent for the body, aesthetically or functionally.
