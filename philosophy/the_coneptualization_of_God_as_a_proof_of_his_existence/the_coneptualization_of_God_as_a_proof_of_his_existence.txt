The conceptualization of God as Proof of His Existence

By Daniel Rangel

How do you justify your belief in God in the absence of evidence?

------

First, I must understand what you mean by "absence of evidence." If you claim that we do not have empirical evidence for the person of God, then your assertion is accurate (Jn. 20:29). However, if you argue that there is no cumulative evidence—empirical or theoretical—to support the existence of God, then you err. The evidence supporting the existence of the Biblical God is vast (Romans 1:20). Moreover, even the very concept of God is support for His existence. The fact that the human mind can conceive of a being like the Biblical God supports His existence, for we know that every concept formulated by the mind is a non-sensory version of something real. In other words, a concept cannot precede reality. We form concepts from reality, not vice versa.

------

It is true that reality precedes conceptualization, for we conceptualize with our brains, and since our brains are real and help us understand the world, which is also real, it is necessary that they operate from reality—that which is, not that which might or may be. Nevertheless, not every product of our imagination is real. Just because I can imagine a red dragon or a flying unicorn does not mean that they are or ever were real.

------

True, not every product of the imagination is real. But even the examples you provided originate from things we perceive to exist. For instance, we know that creatures can have eyes and legs, that there is a law of gravity that allows winged creatures to fly, and that we can interpret light wavelengths in the form of colors like red. Therefore, thought it may not be affirmed that the red dragon or the flying unicorn exist solely on the basis of my imagination, it must be acknowledged that they are derived from cumulative knowledge of what I can indeed prove to exist. Similarly, I cannot prove the existence of the Biblical God through empirical evidence of His person, but I can deduce it from the reality around me—specifically, creation (Psa. 19:1). Thus, the concept of God itself supports His existence. The notion that the concept of the Biblical God-or any supernatural god-is born from the Bible is not valid. The human mind is able to image a Person of higher nature than itself. It is able to deduce the existence of a higher being even in the absence of the Christian Bible. The many cultures that have conceived supernatural deities in the absence of the Bible support this idea. Design, therefore, is also evidence for a Creator. Design-that which is natural-in turn, provokes the thought of Someone supernatural. Yet, there is another error in your logic, and that is that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

------

I see your point, and I agree that the examples I initially provided were not strong enough to support my claim. Let me put it the following way. Let us say that right now, I am imagining a creature so unique that no existing creature shares any of its features. I am thinking of a monster of undefined shape, with no eyes, no legs, no wings, no symmetrical anatomy, and no properties typical of creatures in the real world. I am conceptualizing an entirely new being that does not adopt any of the characteristics inherent to reality. Then, since I am using non-real characteristics, I can assert that no such creature exists.

------

The example you've offered does not differ significantly from the red dragon and winged unicorn examples. Even here, you are constructing a new creature by negating properties of reality—such as legs, eyes, and natural laws—rather than creating entirely new ones. Nevertheless, your starting point remains reality. The monster you created is a monster precisely because it defies the norms of reality, but reality remains the standard. Even your description of it relies on terms grounded in reality. Otherwise, I must ask you: Can you define your monster without using any real-world properties?

------

I must admit, your explanation is sufficiently persuasive for now. However, I do request that you offer a more personal argument for God, beyond the cumulative evidence of external sources.

------

Of course. I am a firm believer that the Holy Scriptures place great value on evidence and analytical thinking. This is why God commanded the Israelites to set up memorials as reminders of His providence, but also as catalysts for questions from future generations (Jos. 4:6-7). But external evidence is not everything. Just as God has given us external evidence, He has also provided internal evidence, namely His Spirit (Rom 8:16). For those who have a relationship with God, His Spirit confirms that He is real. However, because this is personal evidence, I cannot transfer it to you. You must experience it yourself (2 Tim. 1:5).

Consider this: life operates on the principle of personal experience. There are many experiences that are private to the individual feeling them. For example, pain. You cannot prove to me that you have a headache, but I am sure you have experienced one at some point. Similarly, though I can experience God, I can only communicate this experience to you, even if I cannot transfer it. And I must say, the evidence of God's presence is far greater than any pain you could ever feel.
