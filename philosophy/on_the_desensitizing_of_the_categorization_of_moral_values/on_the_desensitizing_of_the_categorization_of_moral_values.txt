On the desensitizing of the categorization of moral values

    Dr. J.P. Moreland states that there are many moral principles that seem to
    reside at the core of every sane human being. Some explain them through the
    process of evolution, while others approach them from a philosophical
    standpoint. He successfully debunks both approaches. I propose that most of
    these virtues are founded on the principle that harm is bad only if the
    results do not yield gains for the one inflicting the harm or for the rest
    of humanity. For example, a considerable percentage of the world population
    is okay with the killing of a baby under the label of abortion, but very
    rarely is anyone okay with the killing of the same child if the sole motive
    is diversion. Thus, I have learned that there is a law at work in the
    categorization of these principles, for they are not categorized by the
    level of harm they cause but rather by the intentionality with which they
    are executed.
