    You say that God often chooses to reveal Himself to people, like Muslims,
    through dreams, but why should I believe that God does something like this,
    since He has never spoken to me in a dream? Even though I have asked Him.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-6">
    Please, let me express myself. God does not use supernatural means for those
    who have the opportunity to recognize Him through natural ways, such as the
    Bible, the miracles experienced by other believers, the transformation of
    their lives, and the fulfillment of many prophecies.
  </p>

  <p class="color-iota fw-6 mb-6">
    But the Bible is not proof; it is just a collection of ancient literature.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-6">There are three points that we must clarify.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The Bible and its claims can be verified. Jesus said: "If you want to
      verify if my words are true, put them into practice," (Jn. 7:17
      [paraphrasis mine]) so the skeptic can do so if he wishes.
    </li>
    <li>
      One can say that the Bible does not prove the existence of God, but
      neither do dreams. If the skeptic does not want to believe in a book: 1)
      written over a lapse of 1500 years; 2) by at least forty different
      authors; 3) which has marked history and influenced the world in
      inexplicable ways; 4) one that is full of statements supported by history
      and science; 5) and which is the most translated and sold book in the
      world, why should he believe in a simple dream or vision? In my opinion,
      the rejection of God's Word is much more serious than not believing in a
      dream or vision. Those who do not accept the Word of God as proof will not
      accept any miracle. (Luke 16:19).
    </li>
    <li>
      There is also another problem with those who ask for a dream or vision but
      do not accept the Word of God: they are making the same mistake twice.
      Their objection to not believing in God is that He is a supernatural being
      that cannot be verified naturally. But the same goes for extraordinary
      dreams. Therefore, dreams and visions are reserved for people who meet at
      least these two conditions: they do not have access to the Word of God due
      to their geographical or circumstantial situation and they truly want to
      know God. Dreams are an exceptional measure, not the norm. God will hardly
      reveal Himself in an extraordinary way to someone living in a culture
      where John 3:16 is written in each corner.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p class="color-iota fw-6 mb-6">
    But will God judge me one day for not having believed in Him, even though He
    has never given me what I asked for?
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6">
    No, in reality, God does not judge anyone for what they have not been given,
    but for what they have been indeed been given. In this case, His Word.
    Additionally, those asking for a sign from God must understand that God does
    not reveal Himself for the mere act of revealing. God's revelation is only a
    means to an end: to enter into a personal relationship with the individual.
    So, if the Bible or a vision brings about the same result, what difference
    does the means make? We must understand that for Christians, God, above
    offering dreams or supernatural acts as proof of His existence, also
    provides the testimony of His Spirit.
  </p>
  <p class="color-iota fw-6 mb-6">
    Yes, this may be true, but I will not be able to have His Spirit until I
    have proof that He is real through a supernatural sign. If something
    supernatural does not happen, I will never have His Spirit, due to the fact
    that I will not believe without one
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6">
    You are falling into the same error. I have already said that God expects us
    to start with what is already in our hands. Why do you want to start with
    what is not possible instead of starting with what is? Is this not an act of
    laziness? Why leave all the work to God? When you are interested in another
    subject, you do not wait for it to reveal itself to you, right? No! You do
    your best to study it and learn it, because it is your responsibility to
    seek it. For example, when you want to learn another language.
  </p>
  <p class="color-iota fw-6 mb-6">
    It is true, the knowledge of other subjects are my responsibility to
    acquire, but remember that they are not personal. If God is personal, as you
    say, and if He loves me, as you claim, then it is His duty to at least help
    me believe, especially when it comes to believing in Him to become His
    servant.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6">
    You are wrong. It is true that God does not wish for anyone to be lost (Eze.
    18:27), but it is not His responsibility to make sure that this happens
    (Isa. 55:6-7) without respecting the decision of the individual. In
    addition, God does not call you to be His servant, but His child (Jn. 1:12).
    The fact that you have not yet understood even this basic principle goes
    back to your refusal to start with the Bible.
