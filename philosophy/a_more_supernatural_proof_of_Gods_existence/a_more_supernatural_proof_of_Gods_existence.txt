A More Supernatural Proof of God's Existence.
by Daniel Rangel.
------

You say that God often chooses to reveal Himself to people, like Muslims, through dreams, but why should I believe that God does something like this, since He has never spoken to me in a dream? Even though I have asked Him.
------
Please, let me express myself. God does not use supernatural means for those who have the opportunity to recognize Him through natural ways, such as the Bible, the miracles experienced by other believers, the transformation of their lives, and the fulfillment of many prophecies.
------
But the Bible is not proof; it is just a collection of ancient literature.
------
There are three points that we must clarify.

The Bible and its claims can be verified. Jesus said: "If you want to verify if my words are true, put them into practice," (Jn. 7:17 [paraphrasis mine]) so the skeptic can do so if he wishes.
One can say that the Bible does not prove the existence of God, but neither do dreams. If the skeptic does not want to believe in a book: 1) written over a lapse of 1500 years; 2) by at least forty different authors; 3) which has marked history and influenced the world in inexplicable ways; 4) one that is full of statements supported by history and science; 5) and which is the most translated and sold book in the world, why should he believe in a simple dream or vision? In my opinion, the rejection of God's Word is much more serious than not believing in a dream or vision. Those who do not accept the Word of God as proof will not accept any miracle. (Luke 16:19).
There is also another problem with those who ask for a dream or vision but do not accept the Word of God: they are making the same mistake twice. Their objection to not believing in God is that He is a supernatural being that cannot be verified naturally. But the same goes for extraordinary dreams. Therefore, dreams and visions are reserved for people who meet at least these two conditions: they do not have access to the Word of God due to their geographical or circumstantial situation and they truly want to know God. Dreams are an exceptional measure, not the norm. God will hardly reveal Himself in an extraordinary way to someone living in a culture where John 3:16 is written in each corner.

But will God judge me one day for not having believed in Him, even though He has never given me what I asked for?

------

No, in reality, God does not judge anyone for what they have not been given, but for what they have been indeed been given. In this case, His Word. Additionally, those asking for a sign from God must understand that God does not reveal Himself for the mere act of revealing. God's revelation is only a means to an end: to enter into a personal relationship with the individual. So, if the Bible or a vision brings about the same result, what difference does the means make? We must understand that for Christians, God, above offering dreams or supernatural acts as proof of His existence, also provides the testimony of His Spirit.
------
Yes, this may be true, but I will not be able to have His Spirit until I have proof that He is real through a supernatural sign. If something supernatural does not happen, I will never have His Spirit, due to the fact that I will not believe without one
------
You are falling into the same error. I have already said that God expects us to start with what is already in our hands. Why do you want to start with what is not possible instead of starting with what is? Is this not an act of laziness? Why leave all the work to God? When you are interested in another subject, you do not wait for it to reveal itself to you, right? No! You do your best to study it and learn it, because it is your responsibility to seek it. For example, when you want to learn another language.
------
It is true, the knowledge of other subjects are my responsibility to acquire, but remember that they are not personal. If God is personal, as you say, and if He loves me, as you claim, then it is His duty to at least help me believe, especially when it comes to believing in Him to become His servant.
------
You are wrong. It is true that God does not wish for anyone to be lost (Eze. 18:27), but it is not His responsibility to make sure that this happens (Isa. 55:6-7) without respecting the decision of the individual. In addition, God does not call you to be His servant, but His child (Jn. 1:12). The fact that you have not yet understood even this basic principle goes back to your refusal to start with the Bible.
